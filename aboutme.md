Hi my name is Mateo Gutierrez!
I am a current Aeronautical M.S. graduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a computational focus. My thesis focused on the viscous and nonequilibrium Effects on the Kelvin Helmholtz Instability using OpenFOAM. I am excited about computational fluid dynamics and have immersed myself within both the computational and theoretical aspects. 

Please preview my CV for more information.
